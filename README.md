Game Description

The program prompts the user to enter a top number to define the range for a random number. After the user enters the top number, the game generates a random number within that range (from 1 up to the specified top number). The player then attempts to guess the correct number.

The program provides feedback on each guess:
    • If the guess is correct, the game ends with a congratulatory message.
    • If the guess is incorrect, the program prompts the user to try again.
    • The game handles invalid inputs, such as negative numbers or zero, by providing an error message and exiting.

How to Play:

    1. Run the script: Execute the Python file from your terminal.
    2. Set the range: Enter a positive integer to set the upper limit for the number you'll be guessing.
    3. Guess the number: Enter your guess. The game will tell you if you're right or wrong and will keep running until you guess correctly.
